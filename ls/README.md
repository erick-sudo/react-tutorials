# Notifications Application

This project is a simple notifications system built with `React TypeScript` using `Vite` as the build tool. It leverages `GSAP` for smooth animations to push alerts dynamically to the DOM and uses `Tailwind CSS` for clean, responsive styling.  

The application allows users to trigger various notifications or alerts, which appear on the screen with custom animations and disappear after a specified duration. This lightweight and efficient system is easy to integrate into any React application that requires elegant, animated notifications.
